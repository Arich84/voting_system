Alright! Let's finalize the entire plan with all the sections detailed for an online school voting system with an admin panel. Here’s the full breakdown:

---

### **1. Homepage:**
The homepage is user-friendly and modern. It will display key information such as the status of the current voting phase (Registration, Candidate Preparation, Voting, or Results) and guide users through the process of registration, checking eligibility, and accessing their profiles.

**Features:**
- **Welcome Banner**: A modern, visually appealing welcome section with a brief description of the voting process.
- **Login & Register Buttons**: Prominent buttons for logging in or registering.
- **Voting Phase Information**: Display whether the registration, preparation, or voting phase is active, with a countdown timer for the current phase.
- **Eligibility Check**: Users can check if they are eligible to participate in voting.
- **Live Results (if applicable)**: If voting is active, show live results dynamically.

---

### **2. Registration Process:**
The registration process is simple, where users sign up and verify themselves through OTP, and CAPTCHA validation ensures secure registration.

**Key Steps:**
- **CAPTCHA Validation**: Ensure the user enters a correct CAPTCHA.
- **Database Comparison**: Check if the user is in the external comparison database. If valid, proceed to create a new account.
- **OTP Verification**: After registering, the user will receive an OTP code for email verification.
- **Session Management**: Store session data for verifying the OTP.

**Admin Functionality:**
- Admin can manage users from the admin dashboard (e.g., approving or rejecting candidate profiles).

### **3. Candidate Preparation Phase:**
After registration closes, the preparation phase begins. Candidates can fill out their campaign details and submit their profiles before the voting period starts.

**Key Features:**
- **Time-Limited Preparation**: A countdown timer showing candidates how much time is left to complete their profiles.
- **Profile Completion Form**: Candidates can enter details like their campaign message, address, etc.
- **Validation**: Ensure only validated users marked as candidates can access this section.

---

### **4. Voting Process:**
Once the preparation phase ends, the voting phase begins, and voters can cast their votes. The system will automatically transition into the voting phase when preparation ends.

**Voting Process Workflow:**
- **Voting Page**: Users see the list of candidates and can cast one vote.
- **Live Results**: Votes are tallied in real-time, and the live results are updated dynamically.
- **Security**: Each user can vote only once; the system will prevent duplicate voting.

---

### **5. Live Voting Results:**
As users vote, the results are displayed in real-time on the homepage or a separate results page.

**Live Voting Features:**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Results are updated dynamically via AJAX or WebSockets without refreshing the page.
- **Graphical Representation**: Use charts or bars to display live vote counts visually for each candidate.

### **6. Admin Dashboard:**
The admin section is designed to give administrators full control over the voting process, candidate management, and system logs.

#### **Admin Panel Features:**
- **Admin Login**: Admins can log in securely.
- **Admin Registration**: Admins are registered by the super-admin and will use OTP to reset their password (not reset links).
- **Admin Logs**: Track which admin has logged in, along with the timestamps of their activities.
  
#### **Admin Control:**
- **Manage Candidates**: Admins can approve, reject, or mark users as eligible candidates.
- **View Voting Results**: Admins can see detailed reports on votes, including breakdowns by candidate.
- **Manage Users**: View and manage registered users, including their voting status.
- **Voting Rules Setup**: Admins can configure the time limits for the different phases (registration, preparation, voting).
- **Feedback Review**: Admins can view feedback submitted by users after the voting process.

---

### **7. Profile and Feedback System:**
Each user has a profile page where they can view their basic information, see whether they’ve voted, and submit feedback after voting.

**Profile Features:**
- **User Profile**: Display personal information (name, email, status) and voting history.
- **Candidate Information**: If the user is a candidate, show their profile details and campaign message.
  
**Feedback System**:
- Users can provide feedback after voting, which the admin can review from the dashboard.

---

### **8. Password Reset via OTP for Admins:**
Instead of using email links, admins will receive OTP codes to reset their passwords. This ensures added security and control over admin accounts.

---

### **9. Notifications and Alerts:**
**Real-Time Notifications:**
- Notify admins and users about critical events such as phase transitions (e.g., Registration ended, Candidate Preparation started).
- Voters will be notified when the voting phase begins, ensuring they don't miss their opportunity to vote.

**Notification Delivery:**
- **Homepage Alerts**: Display banners and messages when the phase changes or important system events happen.
- **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts to users (e.g., when registration opens or closes).

---

### **10. Responsive Design and User Experience:**
The entire system is designed to be responsive across devices, ensuring accessibility from desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

**Features for Modern Design:**
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes on the homepage and throughout the system.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The system should include animations and smooth transitions between phases for a modern feel.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Ensure the voting system is mobile-friendly with clean layouts and easy navigation.

---

### **11. Voting Rules During Candidate Preparation:**
Clear guidelines should be outlined for candidates during the preparation phase. For example:
- **Profile Completeness**: Candidates must complete their profiles within the designated time.
- **Eligibility Verification**: Only users who are marked as valid candidates in the database can submit campaign details.

**Preparation Time Rules:**
- All candidates must submit their profiles before the deadline.
- Any incomplete profiles will be disqualified from the voting phase.

---

### **12. Final Steps:**
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that all phases (registration, preparation, voting) work as intended.
- **Deployment**: Once the system is fully developed and tested, deploy the application on a secure server for live use.

---

### **Conclusion:**
This plan includes everything needed for a modern online school voting system, complete with registration, candidate preparation, real-time voting, live results, and a robust admin panel. The entire system is designed to be secure, responsive, and user-friendly.
